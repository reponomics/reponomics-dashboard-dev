# Reponomics Privacy Configuration Matrix

Status: current for action `v0.12.1`.

Repository visibility and Reponomics privacy mode are separate concepts.
Repository visibility controls who can read the repository. `privacy-mode`
controls how retained artifacts and hosted dashboard output are stored.

## Current Modes

| Mode | Repository visibility | Retained artifact | Hosted Pages dashboard | README output | Secret policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `strong` | public or private | encrypted `dashboard-data.enc` | encrypted during `publish` | private repos may commit metrics when `generate-readme=true`; public repos do not commit README metrics | generated high-entropy `DASHBOARD_SECRET_DO_NOT_REPLACE` required |
| `casual` | public or private | encrypted `dashboard-data.enc` | encrypted during `publish` | same as `strong` | any non-empty `DASHBOARD_SECRET_DO_NOT_REPLACE`; weak-secret risk is accepted |
| `plain` | private only | plaintext retained CSV files | disabled | private repos may commit metrics when `generate-readme=true` | no dashboard secret |

## Strong

Use `strong` as the default. It protects retained artifacts and hosted
dashboard data from people who do not have the dashboard key. It does not hide:

- the existence of the Pages site
- publication timing
- encrypted payload size
- workflow metadata
- metrics deliberately committed to a private repository README

`strong` is still a shared-secret model, not per-user authentication.

## Casual

Use `casual` only when the goal is preventing accidental viewing, crawling, or
casual discovery. It encrypts the same surfaces as `strong`, but allows weak or
memorable secrets. A weak secret can be guessed offline from the encrypted
artifact or dashboard payload.

## Plain

Use `plain` only in private repositories where GitHub repository and artifact
access are the intended privacy boundary. It uploads retained CSV files directly
inside the `dashboard-data` artifact and does not publish a hosted Pages
dashboard.

The action rejects `plain` in public repositories.

## CSV Export

Encrypted dashboards expose CSV export only after unlock. Export is
browser-local: the page downloads an encrypted export asset, decrypts with the
dashboard key, verifies SHA-256 digests, and downloads a ZIP of retained CSV
files without uploading plaintext CSV back to GitHub.

For `plain`, users inspect the retained CSV files by downloading the
`dashboard-data` workflow artifact.
